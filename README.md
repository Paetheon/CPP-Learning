# My C++ Learning Journey

This repository contains my study notes and code examples as I learn C++ using [learncpp.com](www.learncpp.com).

## Sections Covered:
- Section 1.5: Introduction to iostream: cout, cin, and endl // First attempt at I/O whitespace/punctuation through trial and error.

3-Number Stats Calculator (C++)

. Stats Calculator: A utility that calculates the sum, average, and custom formula for three integers.
o Note: Uses integer division, truncating decimals.

Chapter 2: Functions
Modular C++ Calculator
Project Goal
The primary objective of this project was to learn and practice functional modularity in C++. The aim was to separate the core logic of the program into distinct, reusable functions for input, calculation, and output, rather than writing all the code in a single main() function.
Key Concepts Learned
Function Prototypes & Definitions: Understanding how to declare and define custom functions (getUserInput, calculateResult, etc.).
Parameters & Return Types: Passing data between functions using int and char parameters, and using return statements vs. void functions.
Input/Output Streams: Using std::cin to get user data and std::cout to display results.
Testing Methodology: Using hardcoded values in main() initially to unit test the calculateResult function before integrating user input.
